- Fix: save group apikey in device when autoprovision device (iota-node-lib#1245)
- Use pluginUtils from iota-node-lib
- Add IOTA_MQTT_DISABLED (mqtt.disabled) and IOTA_AMQP_DISABLED (amqp.disabled) flags to disable MQTT and AMQP (#576)
- Set Nodejs 14 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev12 from supported versions)
